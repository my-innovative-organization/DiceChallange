# DiceChallange
Roll and Win: I have implmented my knowledge of CSS and build dice challange game. It consist of two players and whoever get the highest score will win this game. It would be fun and nice to play this game when you are feeling bored. It's really quite simple to play. you just need to click the button which 
would be below a pair of dice and wait for the other player turns to roll. Winner name would be highlited as main menu.
